## Abstract

This proposal describes a structure for the Zcash MoU Development
Fund, to be enacted in Network Upgrade 6 and last for 4 years. This Dev Fund
would consist of 25% of the block subsidies, split into 2 slices:

* 17% to a MoU Dev Fund “lockbox,” which will be allocated in the future
  once consensus is reached on fund allocation or a new non-direct funding
  model is established and implemented.
* 8% to Zcash Community Grants (ZCG) to fund independent teams in the Zcash
  ecosystem.

Governance and accountability are based on existing entities and legal
mechanisms, and increasingly decentralized governance is strongly encouraged.

Upon creation/ activation of a "non-direct funding model" this ZIP should be 
reconsidered (potentially terminated) by the Zcash ecosystem, to determine 
if its ongoing direct block subsidies are preferred for continuation.
Discussions/ solications/ sentiment gathering from the Zcash
ecosystem should be initiated ~6 months in advance of the presumed
activation of a "non-direct funding model", such that the Zcash ecosystem
preference can be expediently realized.


## Motivation

Starting at Zcash's second halving in November 2024, by default 100% of the
block subsidies will be allocated to miners, and no further funds will be
automatically allocated to any other entities. Consequently, no substantial new
funding may be available to existing teams dedicated to furthering charitable,
educational, or scientific purposes, such as research, development, and
outreach.

It is important to balance the incentives for securing the consensus protocol
through mining with funding crucial charitable, educational, and scientific
activities like research, development, and outreach. Additionally, there is a
need to continue to promote decentralization and the growth of independent
development teams.

For these reasons, the Zcash Community wishes to establish a Zcash MoU
Development Fund after the second halving in November 2024, and
allocate 17% of the block subsidies to MoU Dev Fund “lockbox” and 8% to Zcash
Community Grants.

The primary motivations for this hybrid structure are:

* **Moving Towards a Non-Direct Funding Model**: There is strong community
  support for a non-direct Dev Fund funding model.  Allocating funds to a
  MoU Dev Fund Lockbox gives the community time to research and
  implement such a model while continuing to fund grant recipients.
  
* **Avoiding immediate miner allocation**: Without the MoU Dev
  Fund, the expiration of the current dev fund would result in the entire block
  reward going to miners, requiring a future network upgrade to redirect funds
  from miners to Dev Fund recipients, which could be controversial.

* **Mitigating Regulatory Risks**: By minimizing direct funding of US-based
  organizations, the lockbox helps to reduce potential regulatory scrutiny and
  legal risks.

* **Improving Funding Efficiency**: Allocating resources directly to projects
  rather than organizations reduces inefficiencies and better aligns with
  community priorities.

* **Limited Runway**: ZCG does not have the financial runway that ECC/BP and ZF
  have. As such, allocating ongoing funding to ZCG will help ensure the Zcash
  ecosystem has an active grants program.

* **Promoting Decentralization**: Allocating a portion of the Dev Fund to Zcash
  Community Grants ensures small teams continue to receive funding to
  contribute to Zcash. Allowing the Dev Fund to expire, or putting 100% into a
  lockbox, would disproportionally impact grant recipients. A hybrid
  approach promotes decentralization and the growth of independent development
  teams.


## Requirements

**In-Protocol Lockbox Creation**: The ZIP must define the creation of an
in-protocol lockbox where a percentage of the Zcash block reward will be allocated
post-November 2024 halving. This lockbox will securely store funds until a
disbursement mechanism is established in a future ZIP.

**Decentralization**: The lockbox must be designed with the goal of future
decentralization in mind. While the disbursement mechanism will be defined
later, the lockbox should support the principles of decentralization to ensure
future community involvement and project-specific funding.

**Regulatory Considerations**: The creation of the lockbox should minimize
regulatory risks by avoiding direct funding of specific organizations. The
design should ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations to support
the long-term sustainability of the funding model.

**Efficient Allocation Preparation**: The lockbox must be prepared to allocate
resources efficiently once the disbursement mechanism is defined. This includes
ensuring that funds are readily available for future projects and not tied up
in organizational overhead.

**Security of Funds**: The lockbox must implement robust security measures to
protect against unauthorized access or misuse of funds. This includes ensuring
the integrity of the future decentralized voting/signature mechanism.

**Future Adaptability**: The lockbox design should be flexible and adaptable to
accommodate the disbursement mechanism defined in a future ZIP. This ensures
that the system can evolve based on feedback and new developments in the Zcash
ecosystem.

**Non-Direct Funding Model**: This ZIP recognizes there is strong community
support for a non-direct funding model.  As such, ECC and ZF MUST collaborate
with the Zcash community to research and explore the establishment of a
non-direct funding model. The research should consider potential designs as
well as possible legal and regulatory risks.

**ZCG Slice**: The ZCG slice should encourage decentralization and support
independent teams dedicated to Zcash. Major funding decisions should be based,
to the extent feasible, on inputs from domain experts and pertinent
stakeholders.

**Value of ZEC**: In case the value of ZEC jumps, ZCG should not wastefully use
excessive amounts of funds. Conversely, given market volatility and eventual
halvings, it is desirable to create rainy-day reserves.

**Funding Stream**: The ZCG funding stream should conform to the standards of
ZIP 207 and ZIP 214.

**Revisitation**: The terms of this ZIP should be revisited by the Zcash ecosystem
upon creation/ activation of a "non-direct funding model". At that completion of
an NDFM which accessess the lockbox funds, this ZIP should be reconsidered (potentially terminated)
by the Zcash ecosystem, to determine if its ongoing direct block subsidies 
are preferred for continuation. Discussions/ solications/ sentiment gathering
from the Zcash ecosystem should be initiated ~6 months in advance of the presumed 
activation of a "non-direct funding model", such that the Zcash 
ecosystem preference can be expediently realized.

## Specification

Consensus changes implied by this specification are applicable to the Zcash
Mainnet. Similar (but not necessarily identical) consensus changes SHOULD be
applied to the Zcash Testnet for testing purposes.

### MoU Dev Fund Allocation

The Zcash Development Fund SHALL be enacted in Network Upgrade 6 and last for 1
year. The Dev Fund would consist of 20% of the block subsidies, split into 2
slices:

* 60% to a MoU Dev Fund “lockbox”.
* 40% to Zcash Community Grants to fund independent teams in the Zcash ecosystem.

### MoU Dev Fund Lockbox

<u>MoU Development Fund Chain Value Pool Balance</u>

A new development fund value pool balance, denominated in zatoshis, will be
created. This balance will be initialized to zero at the NU6 activation block.

<u>Coinbase Transaction Adjustments</u>

For coinbase transactions, a specified proportion of the block subsidy will be
added to the MoU development fund chain value pool balance and subtracted
from the transparent transaction value pool. The exact
proportions (numerator/denominator) of the block subsidy allocated to the
MoU development fund must be defined to ensure the correct allocation at
every block.

<u>Proportion Specification</u>

The proportions of the block subsidy allocated to the MoU development fund
and any existing funding streams must add up to the intended total at every
block. Before NU6 activation, the actual percentage allocated to the MoU
development fund will be zero. After NU6 activation, 12% of the block
reward will be allocated to the MoU development fund.

<u>Reserve Pool Mechanism</u>

The reserve pool will be a container for the issued supply, distinct from
existing pools. It will not be subdivided into individually spendable notes or
coins. The lockbox mechanism ensures that funds are accumulated and securely
stored until a future ZIP defines the disbursement mechanism.

### Zcash Community Grants (ZCG)

This slice of the Dev Fund is intended to fund independent teams entering the
Zcash ecosystem, to perform major ongoing development (or other work) for the
public good of the Zcash ecosystem, to the extent that such teams are available
and effective. The Zcash Community Grants (ZCG) Committee is given the
discretion to allocate funds not only to major grants, but also to a diverse
range of projects that advance the usability, security, privacy, and adoption
of Zcash, including community programs, dedicated resources, and other projects
of varying sizes.

The funds SHALL be received and administered by the
Financial Privacy Foundation (FPF). FPF MUST disburse them for grants and
expenses reasonably related to the administration of the ZCG program, but
subject to the following additional constraints:

1. These funds MUST only be used to issue grants to external parties that are
   independent of FPF, and to pay for expenses reasonably related to the
   administration of the ZCG program. They MUST NOT be used by FPF for
   its internal operations and direct expenses not related to the
   administration of grants or the grants program.

2. ZCG SHOULD support well-specified work proposed by the grantee, at
   reasonable market-rate costs. They can be of any duration or ongoing without
   a duration limit. Grants of indefinite duration SHOULD have semiannual
   review points for continuation of funding.

3. Priority SHOULD be given to major grants that bolster teams with substantial
   (current or prospective) continual existence, and set them up for long-term
   success, subject to the usual grant award considerations (impact, ability,
   risks, team, cost-effectiveness, etc.). Priority SHOULD be given to major
   grants that support ecosystem growth, for example through mentorship,
   coaching, technical resources, creating entrepreneurial opportunities, etc.
   If one proposal substantially duplicates another’s plans, priority SHOULD be
   given to the originator of the plans.

4. The ZCG committee SHOULD be restricted to funding projects that further the
   Zcash cryptocurrency and its ecosystem (which is more specific than
   furthering financial privacy in general) as permitted by FPF
   and any relevant jurisdictional requirements.

5. ZCG awards are subject to approval by a five-seat ZCG Committee. The ZCG
   Committee SHALL be selected by the ZF’s Community Advisory Panel or a
   successor process (e.g. as established by FPF). Elections SHALL be staggered
   to ensure continuity within the Committee.

6. The ZCG Committee’s funding decisions will be final, requiring no approval
   from the FPF Board, but are subject to veto if the FPF judges them to
   violate any relevant laws or other (current or future) obligations.

7. ZCG Committee members SHALL have a one-year term and MAY sit for reelection.
   The ZCG Committee is subject to the same conflict of interest policy that
   governs the FPF Board of Directors (i.e. they MUST recuse themselves when
   voting on proposals where they have a financial interest). At most one
   person with association with the BP/ECC, at most one person with
   association with the ZF, and at most one person with association with FPF
   are allowed to sit on the ZCG Committee.
   “Association” here means: having a financial interest, full-time employment,
   being an officer, being a director, or having an immediate family
   relationship with any of the above. The ZF SHALL continue to operate the
   Community Advisory Panel and SHOULD work toward making it more
   representative and independent (more on that below). Similarly, FPF should
   also endeavor to establish its own means of collecting community sentiment
   for the purpose of administering ZCG elections.

8. A portion of the ZCG Slice shall be allocated to a Discretionary Budget,
   which may be disbursed for expenses reasonably related to the administration
   of the ZCG program. The amount of funds allocated to the Discretionary
   Budget SHALL be decided by the ZF’s Community Advisory Panel or successor
   process. Any disbursement of funds from the Discretionary Budget MUST be
   approved by the ZCG Committee. Expenses related to the administration of the
   ZCG program include, without limitation the following:
    * Paying third party vendors for services related to domain name
      registration, or the design, website hosting and administration of
      websites for the ZCG Committee.
    * Paying independent consultants to develop requests for proposals that
      align with the ZCG program.
    * Paying independent consultants for expert review of grant applications.
    * Paying for sales and marketing services to promote the ZCG program.
    * Paying third party consultants to undertake activities that support the
      purpose of the ZCG program.
    * Reimbursement to members of the ZCG Committee for reasonable travel
      expenses, including transportation, hotel and meals allowance.

9. A portion of the Discretionary Budget MAY be allocated to provide reasonable
   compensation to members of the ZCG Committee. Committee member compensation
   SHALL be limited to the hours needed to successfully perform their positions
   and MUST align with the scope and responsibilities of their roles. The
   allocation and distribution of compensation to committee members SHALL be
   administered by the FPF. The compensation rate and hours for committee
   members SHALL be determined by the ZF’s Community Advisory Panel or
   successor process.

10. The ZCG Committee’s decisions relating to the allocation and disbursement
    of funds from the Discretionary Budget will be final, requiring no approval
    from the FPF Board, but are subject to veto if the FPF judges
    them to violate laws or FPF reporting requirements and other
    (current or future) obligations.

FPF SHALL recognize the ZCG slice of the Dev Fund as a Restricted Fund
donation under the above constraints (suitably formalized), and keep separate
accounting of its balance and usage under its Transparency and Accountability
obligations defined below.

FPF SHALL strive to define target metrics and key performance indicators,
and the ZCG Committee SHOULD utilize these in its funding decisions.

**Direct Grant Option**

It may be deemed better, operationally or legally, if ZCG funds are not
accepted and disbursed by FPF, but rather directly assigned to the
grantees. Thus, the following mechanism MAY be used in perpetuity for some or
all grantees:

Prior to each network upgrade, based on the ZCG Committee’s recommendation, the
FPF SHALL publish a list of grantees’ addresses and the total number of
Dev Fund ZEC per block they should receive. ECC and ZF SHALL implement this
list in any implementations of the Zcash consensus rules they maintain. This
decision will then be, effectively, ratified by the miners as the network
upgrade activates.

**Furthering Decentralization**

FPF SHALL conduct periodic reviews of the
organizational structure, performance, and effectiveness of the ZCG program and
committee, taking into consideration the input and recommendations of the ZCG
Committee. As part of these periodic reviews, FPF MUST commit to
exploring the possibility of transitioning ZCG into an independent organization
if it is economically viable and it aligns with the interests of the Zcash
ecosystem and prevailing community sentiment.

In any transition toward independence, priority SHALL be given to maintaining
or enhancing the decentralization of the Zcash ecosystem. The newly formed
independent organization MUST ensure that decision-making processes remain
community-driven, transparent, and responsive to the evolving needs of the
Zcash community and ecosystem. In order to promote geographic decentralization,
the new organization SHOULD establish its domicile outside of the United
States.

**Transparency and Accountability**

FPF MUST accept the following obligations in this section on behalf of ZCG:
* Publication of the ZCG Dashboard, providing a snapshot of ZCG’s current
  financials and any disbursements made to grantees.
* Bi-weekly meeting minutes documenting the decisions made by the ZCG committee
  on grants.
* Quarterly reports, detailing future plans, execution on previous plans, and
  finances (balances, and spending broken down by major categories).
* Annual detailed review of the organization performance and future plans.
* Annual financial report (IRS Form 990, or substantially similar information).

BP, ECC, ZF, FPF, ZCG and grant recipients MUST promptly disclose any security
or privacy risks that may affect users of Zcash (by responsible disclosure
under confidence to the pertinent developers, where applicable).

All substantial software whose development was funded by the Dev Fund SHOULD be
released under an Open Source license (as defined by the Open Source Initiative
5), preferably the MIT license.

**Enforcement**

FPF MUST contractually commit to fulfill these obligations on behalf of
ZCG, and the prescribed use of funds, such that substantial violation, not
promptly remedied, will result in a modified version of Zcash node software
that removes ZCG’s Dev Fund slice and allocates it to the MoU Dev Fund
lockbox.
